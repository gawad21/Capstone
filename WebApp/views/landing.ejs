              This product includes a camera that will be installed near your
              pool and will run off an internal microcontroller. The product is
              also paired with a web app where you can view the status of your
              pool and receive notifications when an issue arises.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">
              The system will actively monitor your pool and using computer
              vision it will have the ability to detect drownings, stress
              signals, and even the buildup of leaves on the pool surface, by
              sending an alert through the web app. When this alert goes off,
              the goal of the project is for the potential drowning victim to
              receive help as soon as possible to prevent injury or death.

            <p class="header-text">
              We are 5 students studying electrical engineering at the
              University of Ottawa located in Canada. Before this project most
              of us have never collaborated and we come from many different
              backgrounds, lifestyles, races, religions, genders, and social
              experiences. However, we came together to design this system that
              will help many pool owners with a variety of issues. We have all
              studied electrical engineering for several years with specialties
              ranging from microwaves and photonics to power and sustainable
              energy. This product was designed as the final project during our
              studies in becoming an engineer.
            </p>
            <p class="header-text">
              This project uses many different concepts and skills that were
              developed while studying at the University of Ottawa. When
              deciding on a topic for our project, we found that drownings are a
              leading cause of injury related death for children in Canada. Upon
              learning this, as a group we decided we would develop a product to
              combat this issue. After spending time brainstorming, we decided
              to focus on a way to detect drownings in private swimming pools as
              well as ways to lower the cost of maintaining a pool.
